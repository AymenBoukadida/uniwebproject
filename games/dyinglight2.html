        <h2>About Game</h2>
        <p>Dying Light 2 is an action role-playing survival horror video game featuring a zombie apocalyptic-themed open
            world. Set
            22 years after Dying Light, it stars a new protagonist named Aiden Caldwell (voiced by Jonah Scott), who has
            various
            parkour skills. Players can perform actions such as climbing ledges, sliding, leaping off from edges, and
            wall running
            to quickly navigate the city. It was confirmed that there are over 3000 parkour animations to give a more
            fluid
            free-running experience. Tools such as a grappling hook and a paraglider also aid traversal in the city.
            Aiden can also
            use the undead to break his fall. The game is mostly melee-based with the majority of fighting using melee
            weapons. The
            melee weapons have a limited lifespan and will degrade as the player uses them in combat.[1] Long-range
            weapons such as
            crossbows, shotguns, and spears can be used as well. Weapons can be upgraded with different blueprints and
            components
            which can be found by breaking down weapons for craft parts. Aiden can utilize superhuman skills due to the
            infection.[2] New zombies have been added. Like the first game, the zombies are slow when exposed to
            sunlight, but they
            become more aggressive and hostile at night.[3] During the latter time of day, players can avoid zombies
            roaming the
            streets by staying on rooftops, who would otherwise hibernate inside buildings to avoid sunlight or explore
            the safe
            interior of buildings to find items.[4]
