        <h2>About Game</h2>
        <p>Halo Infinite is a 2021 first-person shooter game developed by 343 Industries and published by Xbox Game
            Studios. It is
            the sixth mainline installment in the Halo series,[1] following Halo 5: Guardians (2015). The game's
            campaign follows
            the human supersoldier Master Chief and his fight against a mercenary organization, known as the Banished,
            on the
            Forerunner ringworld Zeta Halo. Unlike previous mainline entries in the series, the multiplayer portion of
            the game is
            free-to-play.

            Infinite was intended to release as a launch title for the Xbox Series X/S, but was delayed in August 2020
            after its
            gameplay reveal in July 2020 drew negative feedback from both critics and Halo fans.[2][3] Following an open
            beta
            release of the multiplayer component on November 15, 2021, coinciding with the franchise's 20th anniversary,
            the
            campaign was released on December 8, 2021, for Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

            Halo Infinite received generally favorable reviews from critics, with some deeming the game a return to form
            for the
            series. Praise was directed towards its visuals, gameplay, open world design, soundtrack, and story.</p>
