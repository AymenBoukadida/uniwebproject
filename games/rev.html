        <h2>About Game</h2>
        <p>Resident Evil Village[a] is a 2021 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. It is the sequel to Resident
        Evil 7: Biohazard (2017). Players control Ethan Winters, who searches for his kidnapped daughter in a village filled
        with mutant creatures. Village maintains survival horror elements from previous Resident Evil games, with players
        scavenging environments for items and managing resources. It adds more action-oriented gameplay, with higher enemy
        counts and a greater emphasis on combat.
        
        Resident Evil Village was announced at the PlayStation 5 reveal event in June 2020 and was released on May 7, 2021, for
        PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S, followed by a macOS version and a cloud
        version for Nintendo Switch in October 2022, and a PlayStation VR2 version on February 22, 2023. An iOS version was
        released on October 30, 2023.
        
        The game received generally favorable reviews, with praise for its gameplay, setting, and variety, but criticism for its
        puzzles, boss fights, and performance issues on the Windows version; the increased focus on action divided opinions.
        Resident Evil Village won year-end accolades including Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. The game had sold
        8.3 million units by June 2023.</p>
