        <h2>About Game</h2>
        <p>Subway Surfers (Danish: Undergrunds surfere) is an endless runner mobile game which is co-developed by Kiloo
            and SYBO
            Games, private companies based in Denmark. It is available on Android, iOS, HarmonyOS, Amazon Fire Tablet,
            and Windows
            Phone platforms and uses the Unity game engine.[2] In the game, players take the role of young graffiti
            artists who,
            upon being caught in the act of "tagging" a metro railway site, run through the railroad tracks to escape
            from the
            inspector and his dog. As they run, they grab gold coins, power-ups, and many other items along the way
            while
            simultaneously dodging collisions with trains and other objects. They can also jump on top of the trains and
            surf with
            hoverboards to evade capture until the character crashes into an obstacle, gets caught by the inspector, or
            gets hit by
            a train, at which point the game ends. Special events, such as the Season Hunt and other, can result in
            in-game rewards
            and characters.</p>
