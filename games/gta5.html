        <h2>About Game</h2>
        <p>Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is
        the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth
        instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story
        follows three protagonistsâ€”retired bank robber Michael De Santa (Ned Luke), street gangster Franklin Clinton (Shawn
        Fonteno), and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips (Steven Ogg), and their attempts to commit heists while under
        pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. Players freely roam San Andreas's open world
        countryside and fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.
        
        The game world is navigated on foot and by vehicle, from either a third-person or first-person perspective. Players
        control the protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is
        centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A "wanted" system governs the
        aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. In Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online
        multiplayer mode, up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes.</p>
