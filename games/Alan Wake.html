        <h2>About Game</h2>
        <p>Alan Wake went missing in 2010. He was a bestselling writer based in New York City. On a vacation in the
            Pacific
            Northwest with his wife, Alice Wake, he came face to face with a force of supernatural darkness. It brought
            Wake’s
            writing, a horror story, to life. He fought this dark presence and managed to banish it back to where it
            came from, a
            nightmarish dark place hidden under a caldera lake outside the small town of Bright Falls. Wake wrote an
            ending to his
            horror story and with that freed his wife from the darkness under the lake but became trapped there himself.

            Alan Wake is not dead, although he has wished he was many times. For 13 years he’s been a prisoner in the
            Dark Place,
            where his nightmares, his fears, and his stories manifest as reality around him. For 13 years, he has been
            fighting to
            stay sane and write a story that would change reality around him in order for him to escape. So far, he has
            failed.</p>
