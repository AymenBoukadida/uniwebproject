        <h2>About Game</h2>
        <p>Similar to its predecessors, Battlefield 2042 is a multiplayer-focused first-person shooter. As the game is
            set in the
            near future, it features futuristic weapons and gadgets like deployable turrets and drones, as well as
            vehicles that
            players can control.[1] Players can request a vehicle air-drop to any location.[2] The game introduced a
            "Plus" system
            which allows players to customize their weapons on the spot. The class system is significantly overhauled
            and removes
            the four defined classes from previous games; instead, players can assume control of a specialist who falls
            under the
            four traditional Battlefield gameplay classes of Assault, Engineer, Medic, and Recon. These characters can
            wield any of
            the weapons and gadgets that a player has unlocked. Each operator has their own unique skills and gadgets.
            For instance,
            one of the specialists, Emma "Sundance" Rosier, is equipped with a wingsuit, while another, Maria Falck, is
            equipped
            with a healing pistol.[3] Levolution and destructive environments from Battlefield 4 return in Battlefield
            2042, and
            extreme weather effects such as tornadoes and sandstorms which may affect gameplay.[4] The game featured
            seven maps at
            launch, including 'Breakaway', the largest map in the history of the Battlefield franchise.[5]
