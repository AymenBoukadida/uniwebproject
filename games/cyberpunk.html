        <h2>About Game</h2>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red and published by CD
            Projekt, based
            on video game designer Mike Pondsmith's tabletop game series. Set in a dystopian cyberpunk universe, the
            player assumes
            the role of "V" (played by Gavin Drea/Cherami Leigh), a mercenary in the fictional Californian city known as
            "Night
            City", where they deal with the fallout from a heist gone wrong that results in an experimental cybernetic
            "bio-chip"
            containing an engram of the legendary rock star and terrorist Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves)
            threatening to
            slowly overwrite V's mind; as the story progresses V and Johnny must work together to find a way to be
            separated and
            save V's life.

            The game's development began following the release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Blood and Wine (2016). The
            game was
            developed by a team of around 500 people using the REDengine 4 game engine. CD Projekt launched a new
            division in
            Wrocław, Poland, and partnered with Digital Scapes, Nvidia, QLOC, and Jali Research to aid the production.
            Cyberpunk
            creator Mike Pondsmith was a consultant, and actor Keanu Reeves had a starring role. The original score was
            led by
            Marcin Przybyłowicz, and featured the contributions of several licensed artists. After years of
            anticipation, CD Projekt
            released Cyberpunk 2077 for PlayStation 4, Stadia, Windows, and Xbox One on 10 December 2020, followed by
            PlayStation 5
            and Xbox Series X/S on 15 February 2022.</p>
