        <h2>About Game</h2>
        <p>Elden Ring[a] is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware. It was directed by Hidetaka
            Miyazaki with
            worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was published for PlayStation 4,
            PlayStation 5,
            Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco
            Entertainment
            internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring
            and become
            the new Elden Lord.

            Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world.
            The six main
            areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden
            dungeons
            can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including
            non-direct
            engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and
            allow players
            to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called runes. Elden Ring features an online
            multiplayer mode in
            which players can join for cooperative play and player-versus-player combat.
